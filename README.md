Introduction 

Cloud storage has become a popular solution for storing and sharing large amount of data. However, the security of cloud storage systems remains a major concern, as sensitive data stored in the cloud can be accessed by unauthorized parties. One way to enhance the security of cloud storage systems is by encrypting the data before it is uploaded to the cloud. However, traditional encryption methods make it difficult to search the encrypted data, as search queries must be performed on the plaintext. This presents a challenge for applications that require search functionality over encrypted data.
Goal of this project is to implement an efficient searchable encryption scheme for cloud storage. The proposed solution should provide strong confidentiality and privacy guarantees for sensitive data stored in the cloud, while allowing for efficient search queries over the encrypted data. The solution should also have low overhead in terms of storage and computation, making it suitable for use in real-world cloud storage applications. The project aims to address the security concerns associated with cloud storage systems, and provide a practical solution for enhancing their security.
